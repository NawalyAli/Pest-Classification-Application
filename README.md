# Pest-Classification

My Honours Computer Science Project at LSBU.

My goal for this project is to develop an automated system for pest classification using the deep learning method Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This system will aid farmers in identifying pests quickly and accurately, so farmers can decide what pesticides they should use.

This project will use the IP102 dataset, which was downloaded from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonidkulyk/ip102-yolov5) which consists of 19,000 images with bounding boxes for object detection.
